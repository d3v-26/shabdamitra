# Shabdamitra


### Overview
- Designed a comprehensive feature-rich Android application using Flutter and integrated Firebase for real-time data synchronization and user authentication. The app enhances the learning experience & teaching processes across 3 distinct languages, encompassing a vast vocabulary of over 50,000+ words.
- Created and optimized a search index over the extracted words using Python and MySQL. Also fine-tuned the schema, incorporating an audio-visual layer, resulting in a reduction of search time by 30% and an increase in interactivity.
- Extracted information on words with constraints such as proficiency, class, sense, definition, and version from more than 4 different multi-lingual corpuses developed and maintained by the Shabdamitra team at the IIT Bombay.
- Utilized Python and SQL to implement machine learning algorithms for predictive text and language learning insights, further augmenting the educational utility of the application
